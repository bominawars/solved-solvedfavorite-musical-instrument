Create your own Java class that represents your favorite musical instrument. Your musical instrument class should have at least 3 constants, 5 private data fields, getters and setters for each private data field, a toString() method, and three additional methods of your choice. Create a test class that constructs at least 5 of your musical instrument objects. For each of the objects constructed demonstrate the use of each of the methods. Be sure to use your IDE to accomplish this assignment. You can pick any instrument you want. When designing your class, think about what would make sense to describe and use the instrument. For example , if you selected a trumpet, you might need to provide the number of valves, the manufacturer, if the instrument is using a mute, the volume or even notes the trumpet is playing. Make this your own creation and have fun with it.
